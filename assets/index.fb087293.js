Having the opportunity to work at one of the largest multi-manager firms and explore the internal structure was awesome. Millennium is built around a very flat managerial structure (I would have been around 5 rungs below Israel Englander, the CEO) and their unique feature of running each team as an independent hedge fund. Working with a QA team was not something I had ever thought of, it never crossed my mind when all we do in school is the typical fullstack development process. While the majority of my internship revolved around the development of a tool (which is a core QA tool), I was able to learn a lot about the company's methods in assuring quality in their applications, as well as the general integration of development and testing by the industry.","A little more on my project: It was an internal tool that provides the QA team with monitoring and analysis of production queries. It is essentially composed of three main parts:","\u2022 Extract - Pull in production queries that have already been run","\u2022 Replay - Replay those same extract queries in a user acceptance testing (UAT) environment","\u2022 Save - Parse and analyze the statistics of both production and UAT responses, saving that in a timeseries database","That data can then be visualized by other tools. The major challenge was not to develop the program, the core logic was already created by a senior programmer specifically for his team. My challenge was to take what he had and make it generic, allowing other teams to make simple configuration changes and have it work. This included compatibility with various methods of extracting, for example, querying on elasticsearch or parsing logs on a remote Unix server, and various methods of replaying based on either team standards or data collected from production queries. This provided me the ability to work on an existing project, make it better, but also add my own feature (Making it generic essentially required redo-ing the entire program) and speak with other departments (All of whom were either in Millennium's NYC or Singapore office). I thoroughly enjoyed working at Millennium and finally working in person, being able to chat with neighbors and grab lunch with.","But being in Miami also includes living in Magic City. So throughout my 3 months, I lived in 4 different Airbnbs in 4 different VERY different communities, from the the gated serenity of Morningside to the graffiti plaid sidewalks in Wynwood to the calmness of the historic Coral Gables and eventually the familiar hustle and bustle of Brickell, synonymous to the Times Square of Miami.

This was something that would significantly impact Optum's infrastructure, with the ability to move on-site services to the cloud quickly, which in turn, would affect UnitedHealth Group's (Optum's parent company) services.","While there wasn't a large existing codebase we had to integrate into, we were able to leverage internal databases and cross-department tools to increase the utility of our chatbot. This meant having meetings with other departments, collecting configuration details, and ensuring they were in the loop with our development cycle.
