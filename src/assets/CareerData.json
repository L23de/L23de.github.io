This was something that would significantly impact Optum's infrastructure, with the ability to move on-site services to the cloud quickly, which in turn, would affect UnitedHealth Group's (Optum's parent company) services. So I am very fortunate and thankful that I was able to wear various hats and work on something impactful as my first exposure of software engineering",
