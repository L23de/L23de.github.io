        "Biking has always been my go-to thing to do. Now in Rochester, that's my main recreation activity, with lots of road and several challenging climbs by the Finger Lakes. I can also say I've completed my first \"race\" in Rochester and that was a surreal experience. Can't wait to do more and rack up more miles.",
        "I also love skateboards, inline-skates and anything with wheels that I can ride on. Speed is king."
