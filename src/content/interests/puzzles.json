    "Over the course of half a year, I was able to PR with a 20 second solve. For the speedcubers out there, I only used the Beginner's Method with OLL and 2 PLL algorithms (That means there was a lot of room to improve).",
    "But ever since, I've learnt to not just take things at face value and have loved wrangling my head around difficult puzzles"]
