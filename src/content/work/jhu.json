                "My first true break into STEM. I had the opportunity to participate in this selective summer program where it surveyed the various fields of engineering (not just CS). I always knew I wanted to make a career in the engineering space. But I was able to refine that done to the computing sciences/engineering after learning about boolean and logical gates. It was the very logical and straight-forward, there were no \"maybes\".",
                "However, I'm more impressed by the engineers who have been able to abstract such concepts away and create tools that billions of people use all over the world daily. Perhaps, I will be able to join their ranks in the future."
