                <p>Hi, I'm glad you stopped by!</p>
                <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Lester and I am currently a rising senior at Lehigh University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, along with a Data Science Minor. I've always been interested in computing technologies, how they work, and their applications. However, I really only started delving into the nitty-gritty details in 11th grade. Stop by my <router-link to="/work">SWE Journey</router-link> to learn more!</p>
                <p>In terms of my personal life, I'm constantly looking for ways to seek discomfort, ways to push myself out of my comfort zone and expand my worldview. As a kid, I was always very picky and scared to try new things, so to recoup those lost experiences and never lose out on another one, I strive to say <a href="https://yestheory.com/" target="_blank">"Yes"</a> to everything!
